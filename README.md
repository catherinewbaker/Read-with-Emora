# Read-with-Emora
A collection of data associated with the Read with Emora project

To view grade-specific data see the data folder. To view demos and videos of the working website view the demos folder.

Files in the data folder are named by grade with first.json corressponding to the first grade, second.json to the second grade, and so on.
Each grade-specific data file contains a list of vocab words, a set of grammar rules, and an organized set of learning objectives.

The demos folder contains demos for all the major pages and functions of the Read with Emora website.
